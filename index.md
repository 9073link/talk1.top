道言学堂 | Daoyan Academy

Welcome to 道言学堂 (Daoyan Academy), a platform dedicated to a transformative approach to Bible study and interpretation. Rooted in the Double Discourse Theory (DDT), we integrate traditional historical-grammatical exegesis with a focus on performative language, faith response, and life transformation.

Our Mission

To bridge the gap between cognitive understanding and lived faith, empowering believers to experience the Bible as a living, transformative Word.
